        The present district Deoria is situated in eastern zone of Uttar Pradesh. According to official gazzettes , the district name ‘deoria’ is taken by its headquarter name ‘Deoria’ and the term ‘ DEORIA’ generally means a place where there are temples. In previous time it was a part and parcel of Gorakhpur district. By separating from Gorakhpur it came into existence as a district on 16th March 1946. On 13.5.1994 by carving out district Deoria, a new district Kushinagar (formerly named Padrauna ) had been created, by transfering of entire tahsils Padrauna, Hata and Tamkuhi Raj of Deoria district to Kushinagar district and after that it was renamed Kushinagar in 1997. The origin of this district is acknowledged as ancient place of Devaranya and possibly Deopuria. According to the government records the name of this district is associated with the name of its headquarters. The origin of the name Deoria is derived perhaps from the remnant (broken) of the Shiv temple situated on the mound on the side of ‘Karn river’ flowing in the north of Deoria.

As for the rest, many archaeological remnants are found in the form of images, coins, super abundance bricks, temples, stupas and remains of abbeys of Buddha at many places of the district which signifies that there was a developed and organised social life since a long time. The story goes that once upon a time the cow of Vashistha muni was grazing in the forest, where a tiger came and crried away her. On the way it marked a place with her ‘Lar’ (Saliva) falling her mouth. For this reason this place particularly was known as Lar, which became town now, and is situated at a distance of 38 kms. in north-east from the headquarters of Deoria. Another ancient place is Sohanag of cultural importance where main character of ‘Ramayan’, Parasuram residing here, used to practised penance, meditate and worship. In consequence of this the place was known as ‘Parasuram Dham’. There is an ancient pond where two images of the parents of Parasuram. Jamdagini and Renuka are placed in the temple of Parasuram.

        In pre-epic period there was only one Chakravarty ruler whose name was ‘Mahasudassana’. The reference of whose name acquires in ‘Maha sudassana suttanta’. There was none to stand against him. In Mahabharat period Mallas had gained complete ascendancy on this tract. The present regent of Malla suffered defeat in the hand of Bhimsen (one of the Pandavas) on occassion of Rajsuya yagya. After Mahabharat (1400 B.C.) Mallas were succeeded to re-establish their authority and they organised themself in a Gantantra (Republic) and this empire remained intact upto the death of Buddha. They were disciples of both ‘Buddha’ and ‘Mahavir’. They used to go in the district in order to preach sermons. Testimony in this regards acquires in the form of sculpture, clay, seals, votive tablets, ruins of stupas and monasteries. The mounds at Sohnag corroborate the recourse of Buddha. After the end of Buddha’s life his cousin and disciple Aniruddha came in order to give consolation to the Mallas went to the place where funeral rites of Buddha were performed. By the cause of Buddha’s staying in Pavanagar (presently Fazilnagar) this place has become a religious centre at international level for the followers of both ‘Budhism and Jainism’.
